          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p><img src="images/marcyumi.jpg" alt="Marc with a dear friend." style="float:center;width:800px;height:600px;"></img> </p>
        <p>In short, I'm a student artist who is mainly fueled by my nerdy interests and my open mindset. I'm also told by others sometimes that I'm like a living cartoon character!</p>
        <p>I sometimes choose to go under different monikers like "Marxster", "Mou", and sometimes the
           "Burning-hot Devil". The moniker “Burning-hot Devil" comes from my usual affiliation with the Fire and Darkness
            elements generally from when I play a game.
           I primarily create art, because that's what I was pretty much born to do.
            Most of my art is inspired by cartoons and games that I like. My favorite things to draw can range from cute
            child-like monsters to sexy voluptuous women.</p>

     	<p>My other hobbies include playing trading card games and sports, listening to various types of music
     	(my favorite genres are Rock and Japanese music), collecting toys as a hobby and watching anime/cartoons.
     	Some of my favorite shows and games include soccer, table tennis, “Cardfight!! Vanguard”, “Yu-Gi-Oh!”, “Pokemon”,
     	 “Omamori Himari”, “Senran Kagura”, "TOME: Terrain of Magical Expertise”, “Unison League”, and “Custom Robo”. </p>

     	<p>The trading card games I actively play are Yu-Gi-Oh! and Cardfight!! Vanguard. I play Pokémon
     		(mainly the Trading Card Game, but sometimes the video games), Duel Masters,
            the Power Rangers Action Card Game, and other various games on the sidelines. I also like to play Future Card
            Buddyfight and Battle Spirits, but I do not have a deck for either of them in real life, so I play them
            (and others) on TradeCardsOnline as "marxster." If you find me there, you can always feel free to challenge me!</p>

        <p>Aside from trading card games and art, I am actually a pretty quirky guy. I like to compete with others
        (primarily through trading card games, but also through sports like table tennis and soccer), listen to a wide
        variety of music (although I'm not a big fan of many of the big hits today), and I somehow have a lot to talk
        about for an "antisocial person." </p>
